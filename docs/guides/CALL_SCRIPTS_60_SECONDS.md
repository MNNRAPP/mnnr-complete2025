## 🎯 SCRIPT #1: THE PROBLEM-SOLVER (IoT Companies)

**[0-10 seconds - Hook]**
"Hi, this is calling from MNNR. We solve a specific problem for IoT companies - enabling machines to make and receive payments autonomously without human intervention. Is this something that might be relevant to your operations?"

**[10-30 seconds - Value Prop]**
"Here's what we do: Your devices can automatically pay for services, process transactions, and settle accounts in real-time. Think vending machines ordering their own inventory, smart meters paying for energy, or industrial equipment purchasing maintenance - all without a person clicking 'approve.'"

**[30-50 seconds - Proof & Urgency]**
"We're currently running a pilot program for the first 10 companies. You get white-glove onboarding, zero pilot fees for the first month, and dedicated engineering support. We're working with companies processing anywhere from $10K to $1M in monthly machine transactions."

**[50-60 seconds - Call to Action]**
"Would it make sense to do a quick 15-minute demo this week to see if this fits your use case? I can show you exactly how it works with your specific setup."

---

## 🎯 SCRIPT #2: THE DIRECT APPROACH (Vending/Kiosks)

**[0-10 seconds - Hook]**
"Hi, calling from MNNR. Quick question - do your vending machines or kiosks currently handle their own inventory ordering and payment processing, or is that still manual?"

**[10-30 seconds - Pain Point]**
"Most operators we talk to are still manually checking inventory, placing orders, and reconciling payments. That's where MNNR comes in - we enable your machines to autonomously order supplies, pay vendors, and manage their own cash flow. Your machines basically run themselves."

**[30-50 seconds - ROI]**
"Our customers typically see 40-60% reduction in operational overhead and eliminate stock-outs completely. One operator went from checking 50 machines weekly to getting automated alerts only when there's an issue. We're offering a pilot program right now - first month free, you just pay for what your machines transact."

**[50-60 seconds - Close]**
"Can I send you a quick demo video, or would you prefer a 10-minute call this week to see how it works with your specific machines?"

## 🎯 SCRIPT #3: THE CONSULTANT (Smart City/Industrial)

**[0-10 seconds - Positioning]**
"Hi, this is calling from MNNR. We specialize in autonomous payment infrastructure for connected devices and industrial equipment. I'm reaching out because we're expanding into [their industry] and wanted to see if you're handling any machine-to-machine payment scenarios."

**[10-30 seconds - Use Cases]**
"We work with smart city infrastructure, industrial IoT, and fleet management companies. Common use cases include: equipment automatically purchasing maintenance services, sensors paying for data transmission, or vehicles handling their own fuel and toll payments. Essentially, removing humans from the payment approval loop."

**[30-50 seconds - Differentiation]**
"Unlike traditional payment processors, we're built specifically for autonomous transactions. That means: API-first architecture, sub-second settlement, built-in compliance for unattended payments, and SOC 2 certified security. We handle everything from micropayments to enterprise contracts."

**[50-60 seconds - Next Step]**
"We're launching a pilot program for strategic partners. Would it make sense to explore whether this could streamline your operations? I can do a technical walkthrough with your team this week."

---

## 🎯 SCRIPT #4: THE CHALLENGER (Disruptive)

**[0-10 seconds - Pattern Interrupt]**
"Hi, calling from MNNR. Let me ask you something - what if your machines could make financial decisions without you? Would that change your business model?"

**[10-30 seconds - Vision]**
"That's what we enable. Machines that autonomously pay for what they need, when they need it. No purchase orders, no approval workflows, no human bottlenecks. Your vending machine runs low on Coke? It orders and pays for restocking automatically. Your sensor needs more data? It purchases bandwidth on demand."

**[30-50 seconds - Proof]**
"We're already processing autonomous payments for IoT companies, and they're seeing 70% faster operations and 90% reduction in payment friction. The technology exists today - most companies just don't know it's possible yet."

**[50-60 seconds - Challenge]**
"I'm calling because we're looking for 5 forward-thinking companies to be part of our pilot program. If you're interested in being an early mover in autonomous commerce, let's talk this week. Are you open to a quick conversation?"

## 🎯 SCRIPT #5: THE QUALIFIER (Fast Filter)

**[0-15 seconds - Quick Qualify]**
"Hi, this is calling from MNNR. We provide payment infrastructure for machines and IoT devices. Before I take up your time - do you currently have any connected devices, vending machines, or automated systems that need to process payments or purchase services?"

**[If YES - 15-45 seconds]**
"Perfect. Here's what we do in one sentence: We enable your machines to autonomously make and receive payments without human approval. This means your devices can order supplies, pay for services, and manage transactions 24/7. We're running a pilot program right now - zero fees for the first month, and we handle all the integration."

**[45-60 seconds - Close]**
"Based on what you just told me, this could save you [specific benefit for their use case]. Can we schedule 15 minutes this week for me to show you exactly how it would work with your setup? I have slots available tomorrow or Friday."

**[If NO - 15-30 seconds]**
"No problem. Just to confirm - you don't have any automated systems that need to handle payments or financial transactions on their own? [Wait for answer]. Okay, thanks for your time. If that changes in the future, feel free to reach out to MNNR.app. Have a great day!"

## 🎯 SCRIPT #6: THE SOFT SELL (Consultative)

**[0-10 seconds - Curiosity]**
"Hi, this is calling from MNNR. I'm doing some research on how companies in [their industry] are handling payments for connected devices and autonomous systems. Do you have a few minutes to share how you're currently approaching this?"

**[10-30 seconds - Listen & Learn]**
[Let them talk. Listen for pain points: manual processes, delays, reconciliation issues, scaling problems]

**[30-50 seconds - Offer Solution]**
"That's really interesting. Based on what you just described, especially the [pain point they mentioned], we might be able to help. We've built a platform specifically for autonomous machine payments. Companies use us to eliminate the manual steps you mentioned and let their devices handle transactions automatically."

**[50-60 seconds - Low-Pressure Close]**
"I don't want to take up more of your time now, but would it be helpful if I sent you a quick overview of how we've solved similar challenges for other companies in your space? Or if you prefer, we could do a brief 10-minute call where I show you the platform. What works better for you?"
