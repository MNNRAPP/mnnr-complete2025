### 5. **ABACUS AI - PRICING ANALYSIS & METRICS DASHBOARD**

**Mission:** Validate pricing strategy + set up success metrics

**IMMEDIATE TASKS (Tonight - 45 min):**

```
CONTEXT: B2B SaaS pilot recruiting platform launching tonight.

TARGET CUSTOMERS: AI/ML companies, API providers, GPU providers (small to enterprise)
PRICING MODEL: 0% pilot fees (first 100 customers), then 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
CRYPTO: USDC support for instant settlement
PILOT PROGRAM: No fees during beta, full feature access

TASK 1: Pricing Validation
Analyze:
- Is 0% pilot fees competitive for usage-based billing?
- Should I tier pricing (per-transaction vs flat rate)?
- How does this compare to Stripe Billing, Chargebee?
- Value proposition: If agent spend = $10k/mo, 2.9% = $290 vs complex billing setup
- Compare to GPU provider margins (RunPod, Lambda Labs)

TASK 2: Launch Metrics Dashboard
Define KPIs to track first 30 days:

NORTH STAR METRIC: What should it be?
- Total transaction volume?
- Active agent wallets?
- Revenue processed?

LEADING INDICATORS (predict success):
- API integrations per day
- Agent wallet creations
- Test transactions volume
- Developer sign-ups

LAGGING INDICATORS (measure success):
- Monthly transaction volume
- Customer transaction frequency
- Average transaction size
- Revenue per customer

RED FLAGS (what would indicate failure):
- No API integrations in 48 hours?
- High signups, zero test transactions?
- Payment failures?

TASK 3: Competitor Pricing Research
Quick scan of:
- Stripe Billing vs MNNR fees
- GPU provider billing models
- Crypto payment processor fees
- Usage-based billing SaaS pricing

Create simple comparison table showing MNNR advantage.

Deadline: 45 minutes!
